# Chrome extension IT Depends workshops

Your task is to use ready logic and write your own to get the number of words from the currently opened tab and display this information and count the time needed to read them in the pop-up window and icon using the knowledge you obtained during the lecture.

#### For the needs of the workshops, we assume that the statistical person reads 228 words per minute

## Extra goals

1. Create an options page. Store the sum of all words from all sites in `chrome.storage.sync`. Show this data and the time it takes to read these words on the newly created page.
2. Create an options page. Add a state switch that allows user to enable or disable the extension. Store this data in `chrome.storage.sync` and use it in the pop-up window and the content script.

Good luck!
